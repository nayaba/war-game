    <h1> The Rules </h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. 
            </li>
            <li>
            The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.
            </li>
            <li>
            If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.
            </li>
            <li>
            If a player runs out of cards during a war... that player immediately loses.
            </li>    
        </ol>
